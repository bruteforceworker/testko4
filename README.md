AsiaCoin v2.0.1

This is the official fix for Asiacoin, changes include:

  - Blocks address of premine wallet holding 3.2B so it cannot be used to either trade or stake (This is the key change!)
  - Allow for 1% staking even after 10 years.. ad infinitum
  - New POS schedule: 100% -> 1% over 4 years, gradual decline
  - Reverted many of the original bad code used to hide the premine, made premine explicit in code
  - Integrated new logo and icons
  - Edited about dialog box to reference thread, new website and new github repo
  - Edited makefile and qt.pro file to build on Windows
  - Fixed some Windows build failures
  - Added some new seed servers and DNS seed that micryon control
  - Added checkpoint
